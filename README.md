# terraform-proxmox-config

This repository contains my personal Terraform configurations to manage both virtual machines (QEMU) and LXC containers on a Proxmox cluster.  
The setup is modular and declarative, aiming to automate, simplify, and make infrastructure provisioning reproducible and easy to maintain.
